Custom ArrayList Implementation:

This repository contains a Java implementation of a custom ArrayList data structure (CustomArrayList), 
adhering to the CustomList interface. The core focus is dynamic array resizing, 
where the backing array doubles in size when full (e.g., from 10 → 20 → 40 elements).

Key Features:

Dynamic Resizing: Automatically grows the array when adding beyond capacity.

Core Methods: Implements add(), get(), and getSize() from the CustomList interface.

Test Coverage: Validates functionality with 10+ elements, including edge cases.
